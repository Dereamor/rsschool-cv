# About Me
I am 26 years old, I work as an engineer of railway constraction. In fact, my job is not about the construction of railways, not about the development of new design solutions, it is about keeping control of documents. This job does not bring me pleasure and does not provide an opportunity to progress my skills. I want to be a creator, and that is why i'm here. I'm sure that working as a front-end developer will give me the opportunity to reveal my talents and let me have a hand in creating amazing projects. My goal is to gain knowledge in the field of front-end development.
